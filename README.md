# The Number Guessing Game

This was an early practice assignment for javascript in class.

I decided to make it into a small demo project of my early skills in HTML, CSS and JS.
I then decided to use the project as a first experiemt with SCSS.
While the first version only uses alert boxes the second version also shows some design elements and other features.<br>
This was completed about a half a semester into our front-end developer program.

The project uses Bootstrap 4 (with pre-reqs jQuery and Tether), Font Awesome 4 and artwork from Pixabay.
