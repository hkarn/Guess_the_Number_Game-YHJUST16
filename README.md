# The Number Guessing Game

This was an early practice assignment for javascript in class.

I decided to make it into a small demo project of my early skills in HTML, CSS and JS.
While the first version only uses alert boxes the second version also shows some design elements and other features.<br>
This was completed about a half a semester into our front-end developer program.

The project uses Bootstrap 4 (with pre-reqs jQuery and Tether), Font Awesome 4 and artwork from Pixabay.
